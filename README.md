# Microsoft Farmbeats

## Problem Statement
Farmers and agronomists face significant challenges in efficiently managing crop health and productivity due to a lack of real-time data and automated tools. 
Current methodologies for monitoring crops are predominantly manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error, leading to delayed responses to critical issues such as disease, pests, and suboptimal growth rates.

## Our Solution
In partnership with Microsoft FarmBeats, we developed a platform that not only monitoring crop growth rate but also provides a web app for immediate, actionable real-time data directly in the field. Our primary challenge is to design an end-to-end system that simplifies complex analytics, making it accessible and actionable to enhance decision-making and boost agricultural productivity.
